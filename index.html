      <p>Outside of work, I enjoy reading and listening to music to relax. I am currently seeking part-time positions to contribute to honing my communication skills and problem-solving abilities as well as to gain work experience.</p>

    <h3>Favorite Song</h3>

    <h3>Favorite Anime</h3>
    <p>The first time I watched sailor moon was when I was around five. It's a pretty long anime if you watch the original version, but the new version is much shorter because it actually follows the storyline of the manga.</p>
