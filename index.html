    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my profile! My name is Nidia Guadarrama. I am a freshman in Information Technology and Management. I am interested in encouraging more people to use technology to help them in their everyday lives. I hope to accomplish this by protecting user data in order to promote safe application usage.</p> 
    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy reading and listening to music to relax. I am currently seeking part-time positions to contribute to honing my communication skills and problem-solving abilities as well as to gain work experience.</p>

  <h3>Favorite Song</h3>

  <h3>Favorite Anime</h3>
  <p>The first time I watched sailor moon was when I was around five. It's a pretty long anime if you watch the original version, but the new version is much shorter because it actually follows the storyline of the manga.</p>
